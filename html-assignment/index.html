        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I came from a small city in China called Zhenjiang. It's a couple hours beside the metropolitan city ShangHai. I've lived in Canada for 11 years now. I love Canada for its fresh air, but <em>hate</em> the cold winters.In the future, I'd love to move to somewhere warm, or Europe would be nice too.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I like to start my day with drinking a big glass of <abbr title="Water">H<sup>2</sup>0</abbr>. I then go brush my teeth, get dressed and go to school. It takes me about 20 minutes to drive to school. If I have the time, I stop at a Tim Hortons for a large double double, but most morning I just end up running late.</p>
